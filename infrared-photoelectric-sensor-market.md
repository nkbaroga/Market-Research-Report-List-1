<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Photoelectric Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared photoelectric sensors are categorized into two main types: active and passive. Active sensors emit infrared light beams and detect changes when an object interrupts the beam, making them suitable for presence detection and distance measurement. In contrast, passive sensors do not emit light but rather detect infrared radiation emitted by objects, such as heat signatures, making them ideal for applications like security systems and motion detection. Both types play crucial roles in automation, safety, and control systems.</p></p>
