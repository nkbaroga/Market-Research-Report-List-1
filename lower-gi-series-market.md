<p><h1>Lower GI Series Market Size: Global Industry Overview, Market Segmentation and Forecast (2025 to 2032)</h1></p><p><strong>Lower GI Series Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A Lower GI Series is a diagnostic imaging procedure that examines the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, primarily focusing on the large intestine, including the rectum and colon. This series involves the use of X-rays to visualize abnormalities such as tumors, inflammatory diseases, or structural issues. The procedure typically involves the administration of a contrast agent, such as barium, which helps enhance the visibility of the lower GI tract during imaging.</p><p>The Lower GI Series Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to an increasing prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders and a rising aging population that requires enhanced diagnostic procedures. Advances in imaging technology, coupled with a growing shift towards less invasive diagnostic methods, are also driving market expansion. Additionally, the rising awareness of preventive healthcare and the importance of early disease detection contribute to market momentum. Recent trends indicate a stronger emphasis on patient comfort and improved imaging techniques, including digital imaging and integration with artificial intelligence to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This dynamic landscape is expected to continually evolve, reflecting innovations and increasing healthcare investments globally.</p></p>
